The error `404: NOT_FOUND Code: NOT_FOUND ID: sfo1::24258-1750653202393-14e34b3f5d22` typically occurs due to:

1. **Deployment configuration issues**
2. **Build output problems**
3. **Routing conflicts**
4. **Static file serving issues**

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Updated Next.js Configuration**
- Removed problematic export settings
- Ensured proper image optimization
- Added build validation settings

### 2. **Clean Build Process**
- Cleared all previous build artifacts
- Regenerated optimized build

## 🔄 How to Redeploy (Fix the 404 Error)

### Method 1: Redeploy on Vercel
1. **Push the fixes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix 404 error - updated Next.js configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Trigger new deployment:**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Find your project
   - Click "Redeploy" or push will auto-trigger deployment

### Method 2: Fresh Vercel Import

2. **Re-import from GitHub:**
   - Go to vercel.com
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository again
   - Vercel will auto-detect Next.js settings

### Method 3: Manual Check
1. **Verify your repository structure:**
   ```
   ✅ app/layout.tsx (exists)
   ✅ app/page.tsx (exists) 
   ✅ app/components/ (all components exist)
   ✅ next.config.ts (properly configured)
   ✅ package.json (correct scripts)
   ```

## 🎯 Expected Results After Fix

- ✅ Home page loads at your domain root (`yoursite.vercel.app/`)
- ✅ All components render properly
- ✅ Images load correctly
- ✅ No 404 errors
- ✅ Fast loading times

## 🔍 If You Still Get 404 Errors

### Check Vercel Deployment Logs:

2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Check the "Build Logs" and "Function Logs"
4. Look for any error messages

### Common Additional Fixes:
1. **Make sure all imports are correct** (case-sensitive)
2. **Verify all files are committed to Git**
3. **Check that the main branch is deployed**
4. **Ensure environment variables are set** (if any)

## 🚀 Quick Redeploy Commands
